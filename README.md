# Insurance Policy Analysis

_Insurance Policy Analysis_ is a repository that documents comprehensive actuarial analysis for life insurance and financial planning. Developed in a Subcontinent context, this project details calculations for determining optimal policy features, such as annual premium, sum assured, and income replacement needs, based on real-world financial scenarios.

## Overview

This project includes detailed case studies for two distinct personas:

- **Person A:**  
  A single-income scenario with evolving family needs. The analysis covers expected earnings, expenses (including mortgage payments), and savings. It computes the required insurance coverage over a 15‑year term, taking into account life events such as marriage and childbirth.

- **Person B:**  
  A recently widowed individual managing her own and her daughter’s financial needs. The study examines monthly expenses, savings, and major life events (like college fees and wedding expenses) to calculate a suitable level premium and sum assured for a 10‑year policy period.

Both cases involve:
- Estimating current and future financial positions.
- Calculating present values of expected expenses.
- Determining disposable income and corresponding insurance coverage requirements.
- Evaluating optional product features such as health covers, wealth boosters, and partial withdrawals.

## Repository Structure

- **Actuarial Report Group 1.pdf**  
  The main document outlining all assumptions, calculations, and detailed analysis for both personas.

- **Excel Files**  
  Supporting spreadsheets that contain detailed calculations and illustrations.

- **README.md**  
  This file, which provides an overview of the project and its methodology.

## Methodology

The analysis relies on:
- **Present Value Calculations:** To assess future financial needs under assumptions of inflation, salary increments, and lifestyle changes.
- **Cash Flow Analysis:** Evaluating expected earnings versus expenses over a defined policy period.
- **Risk and Protection Assessment:** Determining the adequate level of insurance coverage needed to maintain the family’s financial stability.
